# readr

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/benjreinhart/readr.png)](https://travis-ci.org/benjreinhart/readr)

Flexible Node.js file reading library.

Readr is a library that abstracts reading files from disk. It supports recursively reading multiple files in a directory or reading an individual file via a clean API. It uses [globber](https://github.com/benjreinhart/globber) as its glob engine. Readr's API provides both sync and async operations.

It is tested against node >= 0.8.0.
